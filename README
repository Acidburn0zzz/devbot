SERVEADMIN README
-----------------

devbot is a simple IRC project development bot with two main functions. The first is channel logging to
a MySQL database and the second is integration with Google Code's project hosting to announce issue updates.

devbot was initially based on ilbot (http://moritz.faui2k3.org/en/ilbot), but has been adapted to be
interactive in terms of reporting information on the Google Code project it is integrated with.

For a full list of command line options available when starting devbot, run:

./devbot --help

For help using devbot or full list of available interactive commands while devbot is running, address the
bot by name using:

<bot_name>: help
<bot_name>: commands 

In order to run devbot, the following Perl modules are required:

+ DBI
+ JSON
+ DateTime
+ Bot::BasicBot
+ Config::File
+ XML::RSS
+ XML::FeedPP
+ HTTP::Daemon
+ HTTP::Status
