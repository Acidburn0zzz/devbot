DEVBOT README
-------------

devbot is a simple IRC project development bot. It provides:

+ Channel logging to a MySQL database
+ Integration with Google Code's project hosting
+ The announcement of source revision and issue updates via the above project integration  

devbot was initially based on ilbot (http://moritz.faui2k3.org/en/ilbot), but has been adapted to 
be interactive in terms of reporting information on the Google Code project it is integrated with.

For a full list of command line options available when starting devbot, run:

./devbot --help

For help using devbot or for a full list of available interactive commands while devbot is running, 
address the bot by name using:

+ DBI
+ JSON
+ DateTime
+ Bot::BasicBot
