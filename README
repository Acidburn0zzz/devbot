OVERVIEW

    devbot is a simple IRC project development bot. It provides:

    + Channel logging to a MySQL database
    + Integration with Google Code's project hosting or GitHub
    + The announcement of source revision and issue updates via the above 
      project integration  

    devbot was initially based on ilbot (http://moritz.faui2k3.org/en/ilbot), 
    but has been adapted to be interactive in terms of reporting information 
    on the Google Code project it is integrated with.

    For a full list of command line options available when starting devbot, run:

    ./devbot --help

    For help using devbot or for a full list of available interactive commands 
    while devbot is running, address the bot by name using:

    <bot_name>: help
    <bot_name>: commands
